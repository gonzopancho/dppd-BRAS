tgen example
============

Description
-----------

Intel(r) DPDK based Proto Application implementing a simplified BRAS/BNG
but also possibly other finer grained network functions (QoS, Routing,
load-balancing, ...)

Compile and run this application
--------------------------------

Go to example directory::

  export RTE_SDK=/path/to/rte_sdk
  cd ${RTE_SDK}/examples/tgen

Set the target (a default target will be used if not specified)::

  export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-default-linuxapp-gcc

Build it::

  make O=path/to/build/directory

By default, if ``O=`` is not specified, it will generate in a relative
directory ``build``.

Usage of application::

  ./build/tgen [-f CONFIG_FILE] [-a|-e] [-s|-i]
	-f CONFIG_FILE : configuration file to load, ./tgen.cfg by default
	-a : autostart all ports (by default)
	-e : don't autostart
	-s : check configuration file syntax and exit
	-i : check initialization sequence and exit

To run the example in linuxapp environment::

  user@target:~$ ./tgen -f /path/to/config.file

Refer to Getting Started Guide in ``${RTE_SDK}/doc/rst`` for details
about how to run an application.
